Learning joint text and image embeddings.

Currently attempting to reproduce results from [Klein et al](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/papers/Klein_Associating_Neural_Word_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf), much of the code is available [here](https://github.com/BryanPlummer/pl-clc) from [Plummer et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04870.pdf).

Set `DATA_PATH` in your environment, otherwise all data defaults to `~/data-text-image-embeddings`.

To get started, first get the data by going to `data` and running the shell scripts, read the README for Flickr30k. Then create the data splits, run `process_data_splits.py` in `src`.
